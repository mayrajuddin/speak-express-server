To overcome this, the phonetic system known as Pinyin is used.You'll start by looking at Pinyin and learning how to pronounce the main sounds of Chinese. You'll also explore the four tones in Chinese that represent the pitch and direction of your voice as you say a syllable. Different tones can drastically change the meaning of a sentence so it's important to understand these nuances.",
